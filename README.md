Current working branch is add_buddies.

It's a pun on soulmate. It helps you keep track of your gym workouts, and teaches you how to do those workouts if you don't already know (thanks to some great gifs from musclewiki.org). Select a location from the Google Places API and the app sets up a geofence. When you enter the selected location, it'll prompt you to record workouts, and then give you an encouraging message when you leave (because everyone needs a pat on the back sometimes).

Uses Butterknife, ~~AdMob~~, Glide, Google Places, RxJava, Realm.

Version 2 in progress: ~~moving to Realm from content providers~~ (completed), adding a feature to help you find nearby workout buddies, changing the color scheme.
